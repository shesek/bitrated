      ## FAQ

      #### What is an arbitration service?
      Arbitration is a dispute resolution mechanism where the arbitrator,
      an independent trusted third party, resolves disputes between two transacting parties,
      typically a buyer and a seller.

      The arbitrator is chosen ahead of time, and is to be agreed upon by both the buyer and the seller.
      In case of a dispute, the parties can ask the arbitrator to give his ruling and decide what to do with the money.

      #### How does Bitcoin arbitration work?
      Bitcoin allows using m-of-n multi signature transactions.
      With m-of-n transactions, funds can be paid to a special Bitcoin address
      that contains n public keys and requires m of them to sign a transaction in order to release the funds.

      For the case of arbitration, an 2-of-3 multisig address is created with the buyer, seller and arbitrator public keys.
      The buyer deposits his payment to that address, and releasing it requires the approval of two parties.

      If the transaction ends well and the buyer and seller are in agreement, they can sign a transaction themselves that
      releases the money from the multisig address to the seller.
      In case of a dispute, the parties can contact the arbitrator and ask him to approve a transaction that releases the
      funds in the manner they find fair.

      The arbitrator can only approve a transaction that is signed by either the buyer or the seller,
      and cannot control the funds otherwise.

      #### What is this website?
      This website is provides an interface for using m-of-transaction and a marketplace for Bitcoin arbitration services.

      The transaction themselves are managed using standard Bitcoin technology -
      we merely help manage the technical aspects of using m-of-n transactions
      and have a [directory of available arbitrators](/u).

      We do not offer arbitration services ourselves, nor we are a party to any of the transactions
      conducted using our service.

      #### How do I use this website to create an arbitrated transaction?

      The transaction process has five steps:

      1. The buyer and seller agree on the terms and pick an arbitrator that's acceptable with both of them.
      2. One party starts the transaction by entering the terms, the arbitrator public key and his public/private key
         (which is automatically generated). He gets a link to share with the other party.
      3. When the other party enters that link, he's requested to enter his public/private key (which is automatically generated)
         and accept the terms.
         This sends his public key to the other party, and opens the multisig transaction page.
      4. The buyer deposits the funds into the multisig address (that can be found in the transaction page).
         The funds are locked in that address, until two of the parties (buyer, seller and arbitrator) agree to releasing it.
      5. Depending on how the transaction ends,
         - If it ended well, one of the parties creates a transaction that releases the funds to the seller,
           which sends an approval request to the other party. Once approved, the transaction is broadcasted
           to the Bitcoin network and the funds are released.
         - In case of dispute, one of the parties can contact the arbitrator by providing him with the arbitrator
           link (which can be found on the transaction page) and request him to approve a transaction that releases
           the funds to him.

      #### Is this an escrow?
      No. Escrow services requires the parties to deposit the funds into an escrow,
      where the service provider has full control over them.
      Because of that, escrows are strictly government regulated in the US and most parts of the world,
      making it difficult to obtain an escrow license and raises the costs associated with operating such services.

      With Bitcoin's m-of-n transactions, the service provider never has full control over the funds.
      What he provides is dispute resolution and arbitration services,
      which fundamentally provides the same value to the end-users,
      but does not require adhering to such strict regulations -
      making it easier to operate the service and lowers the costs for both the arbitrator and the end-users.

      #### Help, I lost my private key! Can you recover it for me?
      No. The private key only exists in your browser as part of the URL and in-memory while the service is used,
      and is never uploaded to our servers.
      If you lost your access to the URL, it cannot be recovered my any means.

      That being said, you might be able to recover the URL from your browsing history,
      unless you chose to use incognito or private browsing mode (as suggested in the transaction page).
