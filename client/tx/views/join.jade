      :markdown
        You received an invitation to join an arbitrated transaction. The other party
        provided his public key, the arbitrator public key and the terms of agreement.

        Clicking "I accept" will sign the terms with your key, send the signature
        and your public key to the other party and start the arbitrated transaction.
